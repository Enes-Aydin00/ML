Quick Completing and Converting Numeric Feature\n","\n","We can now complete the Fare feature for single missing value in test dataset using mode to get the value that occurs most frequently for this feature. We do this in a single line of code.\n","\n","Note that we are not creating an intermediate new feature or doing any further analysis for correlation to guess missing feature as we are replacing only a single value. The completion goal achieves desired requirement for model algorithm to operate on non-null values.\n","\n","We may also want round off the fare to two decimals as it represents currency."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":141,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3600cb86-cf5f-d87b-1b33-638dc8db1564","_uuid":"aacb62f3526072a84795a178bd59222378bab180","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-13T12:55:24.131352Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-13T12:55:24.130998Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-13T12:55:24.161327Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-13T12:55:24.160222Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-13T12:55:24.131290Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>PassengerId</th>\n","      <th>Pclass</th>\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>Fare</th>\n","      <th>Embarked</th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>IsAlone</th>\n","      <th>Age*Class</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>892</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>7.8292</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>893</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>7.0000</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>894</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>9.6875</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>895</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>8.6625</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>896</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>12.2875</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   PassengerId  Pclass  Sex  Age    ...
